Assign_GUP (AGUP)
-----------------

Overview
========

Assign_GUP is a tool for the Proposal Review Panel of the 
Advanced Photon Source Small-Angle X-ray Scattering
General User Proposal panel.
The tool helps the panel chairman to assign the most appropriate
reviewers to each panel while balancing the work load across the panel.
It replaces a system previously conducted in Excel spreadsheets.

A goal of this software is to automate this process, as much as possible.
During the development process of this project, it is expected to discover,
identify, and encode the algorithms underlying the proposal assignment process.

The code was first used in the 2011-2 proposal review cycle and was of
some, albeit limited, help.

In the 2011-3 cycle, the software was much more useful (although the 
distribution of panelists amongst the proposals might have contributed)
and the entire process was completed within a few hours.  Previously, the 
process would take about a business day.
